# Notes

This is apart from the PSET and entirely for my own future reference.

If running into future tail recursion issues in Python, try the following package:
https://pypi.org/project/tail-recursive/

I found this after finishing the PSET, and I'm pretty happy with how it
turned out anyway.

To make recursive functions cleaner, Python supports partial application too ðŸ˜„
